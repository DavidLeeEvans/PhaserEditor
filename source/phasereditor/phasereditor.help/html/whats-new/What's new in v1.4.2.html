<p>Phaser Editor v1.4.2 is ready for download!</p>

<p>In this release there are some small  (but nice) new features, bug fixes and a huge update of the base platform: Eclipse.</p>

<h2>Updated to Eclipse Oxygen</h2>

<p>Phaser Editor is based on Eclipse and in this release we are updating
 to the last release of the platform. You can read the Eclipse Oxygen 
release notes here:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eclipse.org/eclipse/news/4.7/platform.php">Eclipse Oxygen - New and Noteworthy &gt; Platform</a></p>

<p>We added the Eclipse Update Site to the editor by default, so you 
will start getting Eclipse updates “by free” from time to time. You 
can disable it on <code>Windows &gt; Preferences &gt; Install/Update &gt; Available Software Sites</code>.</p>

<p>If you have a 4K display please give a try to this new version, there
 is a better support for HiDPI monitors. Any feedback on this is 
welcome.</p>

<h2>New <code>setAll</code> property (scene editor)</h2>

<p>Phaser groups (<code>Phaser.Group</code>) contain a couple of helpfully methods to modify or access the children objects, on of these methods is <code>setAll</code>, that is often used on the creation of scenes to initialize some values of the children objects.</p>

<p>For example, if you are creating a platformer game you can group all the ground sprites on a group and set all the children to <code>body.immovable = true</code> in this way:</p>

<pre><code>groundSprites.setAll("body.immovable", true);</code></pre>

<p>Now you don’t need to write it, you can click on the <code>groundSprites</code> group and edit the <code>setAll</code> property.</p>

<p>The <code>setAll</code> property editor is very simple, it is a dialog with a key/value table. For each row of the table a new <code>setAll</code>
 call will be generated, the first column will be generated as the 
property name and the second column as the property value. Note that the
 name is generated inside a string expression <code>"</code>…<code>"</code>
 but the value of the property is generated verbatim, so you can write 
any expression there, a string literal, a number, a boolean, a function 
call, the name of a variable, whatever you want.</p>

<p>In a next version of the editor we are going to improve this dialog 
with the option of select the property name from a list of common and/or
 user defined names.</p>

<h2>New <code>renderable</code> property (scene editor)</h2>

<p>In Arcade physics games you can use “hidden layers” to add 
physics properties to a set of sprites, like to ground sprites. In 
Phaser Editor we use this technique in retro/fixed size games for 
example.</p>

<p>To hide a sprite but keep it enable for physics you can set its <code>renderable</code> property to false. Now you can set it in the scene directly (before we was setting it in code).</p>

<h2>New <code>fixedToCamera</code> property (scene editor)</h2>

<p>The <code>fixedToCamera</code> property is very used on scrolling 
games, where you want the background or game control objects keep stick 
on the screen. Now you can set this property in the scene editor.</p>

<p>In future versions we are going to add a new Camera object.</p>

<h2>Welcome to JavaScript 6 code generator</h2>

<p>JavaScript 6 is a major update to the JavaScript language. However 
browsers do not support all the features developers prefer to create 
their programs with this language and, if needed compile the sources to 
JavaScript 5 before to publish to the web.</p>

<p>Phaser Editor now supports JS 6 projects and code generators, you 
only need to select “JavaScript 6” in the language field of project 
wizards:</p>

<p><img src="What%27s%20new%20in%20v1.4.2_files/20170824134052-SelectJS6_ProjectWizard.png" alt="Select JS6 on new project wizard" title=""></p>

<p>By default the scenes will get the language preference from the project, but you can change it on the Configuration tab:</p>

<p><img src="What%27s%20new%20in%20v1.4.2_files/20170824134353-SelectJS6_Scene.png" alt="Set JS6 language to scenes" title=""></p>

<p>However, JavaScript 6 is not well supported by the JavaScript editor 
provided by Phaser Editor. This JavaScript editor only support 
JavaScript 5, for example if you write a class it will report a syntax 
error. What’s the option? You can disable the validation of the editor
 and use only its syntax coloring:</p>

<p><img src="What%27s%20new%20in%20v1.4.2_files/20170824134936-DisableJSValidation.png" alt="Disable JavaScript validators" title=""></p>

<p>If you are those who prefer to create the scenes with Phaser Editor 
but code the logic in other editor, then it is not a problem, you will 
get the JS 6 code so you will be able to edit it in the editor of your 
choice.</p>

<p>But if you are those who prefer to do everything in the same place, then we recommend to you to <a href="http://phasereditor.boniatillo.com/blog/2017/04/welcome-typescript-ide">install the TypeScript IDE plugin inside Phaser Editor</a>., that plugin supports TypeScript and JavaScript 6.</p>

<p>We are planning to include that plugin in Phaser Editor and make it the default choice to edit JavaScript and TypeScript.</p>

<h2>Bug s fixing</h2>

<p>We fixed the selection of sprites when are based on textures maps with trimmed white spaces.</p>

<p>The align functions were simplified, now when you try to align a 
single sprite it will get a reference the scene bounds and not the 
parent group bounds.</p>

<h2>Thanks</h2>

<p>Thanks to <a href="https://github.com/OmarShehata">OmarShehata</a> for the fixing of <a href="https://github.com/boniatillo-com/PhaserEditor/commit/bbdf1dc5b58b4352b4df80d002e01771651e893e">some grammar/language issues</a> with the docs :)</p>

<p>Keep in touch! For the next release we are going to add support to Text objects in the scene editor.</p>
