                    <p>This is a small guide you can follow to start writing your games and perform common tasks related to the editor's features.</p>

<h2>Run Phaser Editor</h2>

<p>The first time you run Phaser Editor a Workspace Launcher dialog is 
open. In this dialog you have to set the path to the folder where you 
want to create the workspace.</p>

<p>A workspace is the conatiner folder of your projects. All your 
projects will be created inside the workspace, but also, in the 
workspace are saved your preferences. This means, that if you start 
Phaser Editor and select a workspace, the editor will get the 
preferences saved there.</p>

<p>A project is a folder where you add the code of your game. So you can create many projects in the same workspace.</p>

<h2>Create project</h2>

<p>Projects are created via the Phaser Project wizard. Go to the main menu: <code>File &gt; New &gt; Phaser Project</code>. Note in that New menu are listed all the wizards to create the Phaser related files.</p>

<p>If you press <code>CTRL+N</code> , a New dialog is open and shows all
 the available New wizards. You can expand the Phaser node and select 
the wizard you want to run. Also you can filter the content with a <code>phaser</code> keyword to find it faster.</p>

<p>In the Phaser Project wizard you have to select one of the templates are shown. These templates are grouped in four main groups:</p>

<ol>
<li>Main Templates: provided by Phaser Editor. We recommend to start 
with them. The main difference is that those templates include an asset 
pack file and the code to load it.</li>
<li>Phaser Coding Tips: contains the issues of the <a href="http://phaser.io/learn/official-tutorials" title="official Phaser tutorials">official Phaser tutorials</a>.</li>
<li>Phaser Templates: contains the templates listed in the Phaser github repo.</li>
<li>Phaser Examples: contains the official Phaser examples. These 
templates are a great resource to learn and test Phaser features, you 
can create a project, run it and modify it.</li>
</ol>

<p>After you select the template you can press <code>Finish</code> to create a project with an auto-generated name, or click <code>Next</code> to change it.</p>

<h2>The Project Explorer</h2>

<p>The Project Explorer is a view with all the projects of the 
workspace. It is like a filesystem explorer, you can browse your 
projects and apply actions to the folders or files (open a file, create a
 folder, optimize the PNG of a folder, etc...).</p>

<p>A nice feature of Phaser Editor is the preview of the assets. In the 
Project Explorer you have two ways of preview the media files: hover the
 file with the mouse or select it and press <code>CTRL+ALT+V</code>.</p>

<p><img src="First%20steps%20-%20Phaser%20Editor%20Blog_files/20151022041833-ProjectExplorerPreview.png" alt="Project Explorer preview image file"></p>

<p>By default, Phaser Editor updates the Project Explorer if the 
workspace is changed by external programs (for example if you modify, 
delete or add a file in the OS explorer). However, you can update the 
Project Explorer manually if you select a resource (project, folder or 
file) and press <code>F5</code> .</p>

<h2>Run the game</h2>

<p>To run your game there is a button in the main toolbar, it opens the 
default OS browser and start a built-in HTTP server to listen in a 
random free port. First you have to select, in the Project Explorer, the
 project you want to run, then press the Run Phaser Project button in 
the main toolbar (or press <code>ALT+F5</code> ).</p>

<p>To run your game we said that you have to select the project of your 
game, but really you can select any file or folder of the project, or 
the file of the active editor can be used to know what project to run.</p>

<p>Phaser Editor has a built-in HTTP server (<a href="http://eclipse.org/jetty">Jetty</a>)
 for static content. The first time you run a project, the server is 
started and serves all the static content of the workspace. So, in the 
browser is open an URL like: <code>http://localhost:1982/YourGameName/WebContent/index.html</code>.</p>
