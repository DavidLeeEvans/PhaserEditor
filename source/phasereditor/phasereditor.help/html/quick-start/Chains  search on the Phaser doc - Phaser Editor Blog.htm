                <div class="desc text-left" itemprop="articleBody">
                    <p>Phaser Chains is a tool we did to search the Phaser docs. It has an <a href="http://phaserchains.boniatillo.com/">original online version</a> and was integrated in some editors like Brackets, IntelliJ, Eclipse and the <a href="http://phaser.io/learn/chains">Phaser website</a>.</p>

<p>In Phaser Editor we support a native and well integrated version of 
Chains. When you open Phaser Editor, by default it shows the Chains view
 in the bottom panel. It is the main source you have to access the 
Phaser documentation.</p>

<p>However Chains is used by hundred of developers is possible some 
methods or properties are not listed there, it happens because to build 
the chains we parse the Phaser jsdocs and this is not always 100% 
accurate, so if you see there is a method or property is missing in 
Chains we recommend to checkout the official Phaser Documentation.</p>

<h2>Search for chains</h2>

<p>The main difference of this tool with a common documentation view is that you search for a method chain like:</p>

<p><code>game.add.</code></p>

<p>As you can see the Phaser API makes an extensive use of method/properties chains like <code>game.load.image()</code> or <code>sprite.animations.add</code>.
 So the Chains idea is that you type the chain you are interested to 
investigate and then it shows all the matching chains of the Phaser API.</p>

<p>In the screenshot you can see in the left panel it shows the matching
 chains. If you click it then it opens the documentation of the last 
element of the chain. This documentation is shown in the JSDoc tab that 
is next to the Search tab:</p>

<p><img src="Chains%20%20search%20on%20the%20Phaser%20doc%20-%20Phaser%20Editor%20Blog_files/20151022094428-Chains_JSDoc.png" alt="Chains: JSDoc tab"></p>

<p>In addition to the JSDoc you can see the source code of a chain. Just
 right click on a chain and select Show Source Code. It opens an editor 
with the source code of the chain.</p>

<h2>Search examples</h2>

<p>An important source to learn the Phaser stuff is browsing the 
examples are published in the Phaser website and included in the Phaser 
download. These examples are small but complete snippets of code that 
demonstrate and explain a particular question of Phaser.</p>

<p>In Phaser Editor we provide these examples as project templates so 
you can study Phaser creating an example project. However, it is very 
useful to have the examples also available in Chains, they are a perfect
 complement for the  documentation. So when you search for a chain, in 
the right panel of Chains it shows the matching lines in the different 
examples. In this way you can discover how that API is used in Phaser.</p>

<p>To see the complete example, as we said, you can create a project 
based in a particular example, but also in Chains you can click the row 
of the example and it opens the complete example's file.</p>

<p>The drawback of an example opened from the Chains is that you cannot 
run it, but the advantage is that you get a quick view of it.</p>

<h2>Using wildcards</h2>

<p>A powerful feature of Chains is that you can search using wildcards <code>*</code>.
 This allow to you to find chains that you are not sure how they are 
writing but you remember some parts of it. For example, if in your game 
you need to listen for an input down event you can write a search 
pattern like this:</p>

<p><code>game*down*add</code></p>

<p>It matches with:</p>

<p><img src="Chains%20%20search%20on%20the%20Phaser%20doc%20-%20Phaser%20Editor%20Blog_files/20151022105406-Chains_Match1.png" alt="Chains: matches down signal"></p>

<p>If you want to know what classes are extending the <code>Phaser.Sprite</code> then you can search for:</p>

<p><code>extends*Sprite</code></p>

<p><img src="Chains%20%20search%20on%20the%20Phaser%20doc%20-%20Phaser%20Editor%20Blog_files/20151022105827-Chains_Match2.png" alt="Chains: matches Sprite inheritance"></p>

<p>So you can do many combinations.</p>
