                    <p>Texture atlas is an important resource that developers have to improve the performance of their games.</p>

<p>In Phaser Editor we give full support to texture atlas, we provide 
the Atlas Editor to do the job. There are other external tools that you 
can use but we think that integrating a texture packer in Phaser Editor 
is part of our philosophy of deliver a complete and integrated 
development environment.</p>

<p>Our Atlas Editor uses the <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/tree/master/extensions/gdx-tools">LibGDX Texture Packer</a>, it features the MaxRect algorithm and can be tuned to satisfy the requirements of the majority of the games.</p>

<h2>Create the atlas</h2>

<p>To create an atlas click on <code>File &gt; New &gt; Atlas Generator File</code>, it opens a dialog to set the name of the atlas and the container folder. This container folder should be a sub-folder of <code>assets</code> folder.</p>

<p><img src="Texture%20Atlas%20editor%20-%20Phaser%20Editor%20Blog_files/20151021181700-NewAtlasWizard.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>

<p>When you press <code>Finish</code>, a file <code>myatlas.atlas</code>
 is created and the Atlas Editor is open to edit it. This file does not 
contains any relation with Phaser, else it contains Phaser Editor 
related stuff, like the atlas settings and the path of the source 
images. So you should exclude it from a game build,  but keep it on your
 game development source.</p>

<p>One time the atlas file is created and the Atlas Editor is open to edit it then you can start adding images to the atlas.</p>

<p>To add the image files to the atlas follow these steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Select the image files in the Project Explorer.</li>
<li>Drag the files and drop them into the atlas editor. You can also 
drop complete folders, in that case it adds the image files in depth.</li>
<li>Save the atlas file (<code>CTRL+S</code> or <code>File &gt; Save</code>). It generates the Phaser atlas JSON file (with the JSON Hash format) and the texture image (PNG) file.</li>
</ol>

<p>The last step is very important, remember <code>myatlas.atlas</code> 
file is a specific Phaser Editor file, it is a configuration file used 
to generate the real JSON atlas and PNG texture file. So when you save 
the editor's content a <code>myatlas.json</code> and <code>myatlas.png</code> files are generated. These are the files you should load in your game. Also note the source images are not placed under the <code>assets</code> folder else under the <code>Design</code> folder. Phaser Editor creates the <code>Design</code>
 folder and encourages  the developer to put there the files are not 
included in the game but are used to generate the game assets, like is 
the case of the atlas source images.</p>

<p>To load the atlas in your game you can use the <code>Phaser.Loader.atlasJSONHash()</code> method or load the <a href="http://phasereditor.boniatillo.com/blog/quick-start/020-asset-pack">Asset Pack</a> file.</p>

<h2>Tuning the atlas parameters</h2>

<p>Atlas textures can be used in different objects of your game like 
sprites, tile sprites, sprite-sheets, etc.. Often you should adjust the 
parameters of the packer to get a texture applicable to the different 
functions.</p>

<p>To change these parameter click the "wrench icon" in the editor toolbar. It opens the Settings dialog:</p>

<p><img src="Texture%20Atlas%20editor%20-%20Phaser%20Editor%20Blog_files/20151022053313-AtlasEditor_Settings.png" alt="Atlas Editor: settings"></p>

<p>The settings are:</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Min/Max Size</strong>: to change the size of the texture 
image. There are cases where the editor generates more than one Phaser 
(JSON) atlas files. It is because the texture has no space for all 
images so it creates another atlas to put there the remaining images. 
However you can change the max size of the texture to make space for all
 the sprites.</li>
<li><strong>Size constraints</strong>: you can select <code>Any Size</code> (default) or <code>POT (Power of 2)</code>.
 In the second case the editor generates a texture with a size power of 
2. In some platforms this kind of textures performs better.</li>
<li><strong>Padding</strong>: it controls the spacing between the 
sprites. It is useful to remove artifacts from sprites animations, tile 
sprites, in general when the source images has color pixels in the 
borders. By default it puts 2.</li>
<li><strong>Strip white spaces</strong>: to remove the extra space of 
sprites. If your source images have extra space (transparent areas) 
around the picture, then activating these parameters the editor 
generates a texture that removes that spaces and a JSON file that 
specify to Phaser to render the sprites with the right spacing. By 
default these parameters are on.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Multiple pages</h2>

<p>As we mentioned before, it is possible that one texture has no enough
 space for all the sprites, then many "pages" or textures are generated 
to place the remaining sprites.</p>

<p>When this happens the editor creates multiple tabs to show all the 
textures and generates the Phaser atlas files with a number suffix. For 
example, if the packer generates two textures we get the files <code>myatlas1.json</code>, <code>myatlas1.png</code>, <code>myatlas2.json</code> and <code>myatlas2.png</code>:</p>

<h2>The side panel</h2>

<p>Close to the wrench tool icon there is the "side panel" icon. By 
default the side panel is hidden but you can show it selecting that 
icon.</p>

<p>This panel shows the name of the sprites and a small window with the sprites and pages information.</p>

<p>When you click on a sprite in the right panel (canvas), that sprite 
is selected in the side panel, and when you select a sprite in the side 
panel, it is highlighted in the texture canvas.</p>

<p>You can delete some sprites by selecting it and pressing the <code>DEL</code>
 key or clicking on the delete icon that is placed in the editor's 
toolbar. Remember each time you change the atlas you should save it to 
generate the Phaser files.</p>

<h2>Update the atlas with external changes</h2>

<p>In the editor's toolbar you can see a "gear" icon, click it to 
re-build the atlas. When you change the source image files then you 
should rebuild the atlas to regenerate the texture, do this by pressing 
that "gear" icon.</p>

<p>When you rebuild the atlas the editor shows a dialog to confirm that 
you want to save the atlas, if you accept, then the atlas  is saved and 
the Phaser atlas files are generated.</p>
