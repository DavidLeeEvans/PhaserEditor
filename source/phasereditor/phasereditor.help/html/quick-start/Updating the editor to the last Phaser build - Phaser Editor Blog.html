                <div class="desc text-left" itemprop="articleBody">
                    <p><strong>We are editing this document right now</strong></p>

<p>Each time we release Phaser Editor will support the Phaser version of at the meoment. However, in the last time Phaser is updated in small periods of time, what makes it really hard to keep the editor linked to the last Phaser build.</p>

<p>For that reason we created what we call the <a href="https://github.com/boniatillo-com/PhaserEditor-PhaserBundle">Phaser Bunde</a>. It is a repository with the data used by many components of the editor that requires the Phaser source, examples and metadata.</p>

<p>The Phaser data is used in the editor when you create a project (it adds the <code>phaser.js</code>) or when you select a Phaser Example template (it fetch the source of the Phaser example) or when you open Chains, it uses metadata generated from the Phaser sources, or in the JavaScript editor to auto-complete the Phaser API, etc...</p>

<p>So if the user wants to enjoy the last Phaser version in all the features of the editor, what he has to do is to download or clone (or update) the Phaser Bundle repository, and point it from the editor.</p>

<h2>Link the editor with a Phaser Bundle</h2>

<p>When a new Phaser version is released, we update the Phaser Bundle and make it available for the public (it can take a week).</p>

<p>These are the steps you have to follow to include the bundle in the editor:</p>

<ol>
<li>Download, clone or update the <a href="https://github.com/boniatillo-com/PhaserEditor-PhaserBundle">Phaser Bundle</a> repo.</li>
<li>Open the Phaser preferences  page: <code>Window &gt; Preferences &gt; Phaser Editor &gt; Phaser</code>.</li>
<li>Check the <strong>Use the Built-in Phaser bundle</strong> or set the <strong>External Phaser Bundle path</strong>. </li>
<li>It will ask for an application restart.</li>
</ol>
