Press the up arrow key or tap the center to turn on the engine.<\/p><p>The ship now has a <code>DRAG<\/code> component. <code>DRAG<\/code> works by applying a velocity in the opposite direction of the ship movement whenever the ship is not accelerating. This causes the ship to slow down gradually when the engine is off.<\/p>",
