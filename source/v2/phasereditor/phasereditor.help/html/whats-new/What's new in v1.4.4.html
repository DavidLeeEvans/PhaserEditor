                    <p>Hello,</p>

<p>Today we are release the v1.4.4 of Phaser Editor. This is a minor 
release we did for bug fixes and some small but nice features or 
changes.</p>

<h2>Bug fixes</h2>

<ul>
<li>Fixed <a href="https://github.com/boniatillo-com/PhaserEditor/issues/64">#64 Move asset to section refactoring</a> operation.</li>
<li>Fixed <a href="https://github.com/boniatillo-com/PhaserEditor/issues/63">#63 baseClass of prefab create from selection</a>.</li>
<li>Canvas: repaint Design tab when something is changed on the Configuration tab.</li>
<li>Canvas: do not do a custom paint of modified properties in the Properties Grid (to look better on GTK).</li>
<li>Do not force focus on hover, on Preview image based components.</li>
<li>Better painting  of sprite-sheet previews.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Canvas</h2>

<p>The transformation icons now are blue, like the other icons related to the Canvas objects:</p>

<p><img src="What's%20new%20in%20v1.4.4_files/20171217111010-TransformIconsToolbar.png" alt="Transformation icons"></p>

<p>The selection box now uses a solid stroke and a shadow, to make it 
more visible. In addition, it shows the name of the selected object:</p>

<p><img src="What's%20new%20in%20v1.4.4_files/20171217140622-NewSelectionBoxStyle.png" alt="New selection box style"></p>

<p>The scale tool now shows a handler in all the directions:</p>

<p><img src="What's%20new%20in%20v1.4.4_files/20171217140828-ScaleTool.png" alt="Scale tools"></p>

<p>The Animations dialog allows multiple selection of the frames, so now
 you can reorder (or delete) a couple of them at the same time:</p>

<h2>Projects wizard</h2>

<p>Both Phaser Project and Phaser Example Project wizard now include the
 options to select the Working Set of the project. A Working Set groups 
the projects into the Project Explorer so you can filter large 
workspaces and better focus on a task.</p>

<p><img src="What's%20new%20in%20v1.4.4_files/20171217134215-ProjectWizardSelectWorkspace.png" alt="Select working set"></p>

<p>To configure the Working Sets of the Project Explorer click on the <code>Select Working Set...</code> menu option:</p>

<p><img src="What's%20new%20in%20v1.4.4_files/20171217134751-ConfigureWorkingSets.png" alt="Configure Working Sets"></p>

<p>We recommend to create Working Sets of type <strong>Resources</strong>.</p>

<p>The Phaser Example Project now uses as default name for the project the name of the selected example:</p>

<p><img src="What's%20new%20in%20v1.4.4_files/20171217141156-PhaserExampleProjectDefaultName.png" alt="Phaser Example Project default name"></p>

<p>The Phaser Project templates without assets now uses a text object in
 the scenes. This makes easier to clear the scenes and start the real 
ones.</p>

<p><img src="What's%20new%20in%20v1.4.4_files/20171217140222-HelloWorldScene.png" alt="Hello world scenes"></p>

<h2>Go Into</h2>

<p>Go Into is a command that creates a frame or scope in the Project 
Explorer. This allows the user to show only a specific  folder in the 
Project Explorer. For example, if you are working only n certain levels,
 you can Go Into the containing folder so you will get quick access to 
that scenes.</p>

<p><img src="What's%20new%20in%20v1.4.4_files/20171217134525-GoInto.png" alt="go Into command"></p>

<h2>Preview</h2>

<p>Improved the sprite-sheet preview labels. They are yellow now:</p>

<p><img src="What's%20new%20in%20v1.4.4_files/20171217135019-SpritesheetPreviewLabels.png" alt="Sprite-sheet preview"></p>

<p>The atlas preview shows the frames sorted by names:</p>

<p><img src="What's%20new%20in%20v1.4.4_files/20171217135904-AtlasPreviewSorted.png" alt="Atlas preview, sorted sprites"></p>

<p>We hope this is the last release of 2017 (unless blocking issues forces a new one). We wish a happy new year for all of you!</p>
