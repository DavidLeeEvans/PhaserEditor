<p>Hi!</p>

<p>Today we release an exciting new Phaser Editor version.  We added new  <br>
features like the Text object, the Text, Tile and Button prefabs, the  <br>
internal browser, the Local Phaser Examples Website and the new  <br>
<code>autoLoad</code> parameter to get more control of the assets loading. </p>

<h2>Scene editor</h2>

<h3>New Text object</h3>

<p>To create Text (<code>Phaser.Text</code>) objects right click on the scene and  <br>
select <code>Add.. &gt; Text</code>:</p>

<p><img src="What's new in v1.4.3_files/20171025102824-AddText.png" alt="Add text menu" title=""></p>

<p>It opens a dialog to set the text content:</p>

<p><img src="What's new in v1.4.3_files/20171025102953-AddTextDialog.png" alt="Add text dialog" title=""></p>

<p>For the moment these are the Text parameters supported by Phaser Editor:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>text</code>: The text content.</li>
<li><code>style.font</code>: The name of the font.</li>
<li><code>style.fontSize</code>: The font size in pixels.</li>
<li><code>style.fontWeight</code>: <code>BOLD</code> or <code>NORMAL</code>.</li>
<li><code>style.fontStyle</code>: <code>REGULAR</code> or <code>ITALIC</code>.</li>
<li><code>style.fill</code>: The text color.</li>
<li><code>style.stroke</code>: The text stroke color.</li>
<li><code>style.strokeThickness</code>: The stroke width.</li>
<li><code>style.backgroundColor</code>: The background color of the text.</li>
<li><code>style.align</code>: The text horizontal alignment (<code>LEFT</code>, <code>CENTER</code>,  <br>
<code>RIGHT</code>)</li>
</ul>

<p>A Text object is generated to code like this:</p>

<pre><code>this.add.text(340, 212, 'Hello', {
        "font" : "bold 20px Arial",
        "align" : "center"
    });</code></pre>

<p>To change the content of a Text object select it and press <code>Ctrl+T</code>.</p>

<h4>Text prefabs</h4>

<p>Text Prefab is the method we recommend to create different Text objects  <br>
with the same style and behavior.  A Text prefab is like any other  <br>
sprite prefab, but it extends the <code>Phaser.Text</code> class.</p>

<p>To create a Text prefab select <code>File &gt; New &gt; Sprite Prefab File</code>,  <br>
it opens the New Sprite wizard. In the first page enter the name of the  <br>
prefab and press Next. On the following page select the <code>Phaser.Text</code>  <br>
value of the <strong>Sprite Type</strong> parameter:</p>

<p><img src="What's new in v1.4.3_files/20171025133805-NewTextPrefabWizard.png" alt="New Text prefab wizard" title=""></p>

<p>To create Text prefab instances just drag the prefab from the Assets  <br>
window and drop it in the scene. To change the content or style of a  <br>
Text prefab instance you have to override the <code>text</code> or <code>textStyle</code>  <br>
property. Just select the object and press <code>R</code>, it opens the Prefab  <br>
Override dialog, where you can select the properties to override:</p>

<p><img src="What's new in v1.4.3_files/20171025134333-TextPrefabInstanceOverride.png" alt="Override text properties" title=""></p>

<h4>Custom fonts</h4>

<p>The Text objects use the fonts installed on your system, keep this in  <br>
mind when you use custom fonts. Not all fonts are available on all the  <br>
platforms. You always have the option of pack the font file together  <br>
with the game and load it via CSS.</p>

<p>Phaser Editor uses JavaFX to render the scene but Phaser uses the  <br>
browser, this could result in different metrics. For the next release,  <br>
we will try to mimic how Phaser layout fonts to provide a more accurate  <br>
design-time rendering.</p>

<h3>Support for Text, Tile and Button prefabs</h3>

<p>Like sprite and group prefabs, text, tile and button prefabs could be  <br>
very useful in your game. In the previous section, we explained how to  <br>
create a Text prefab, the other type of sprite prefabs can be created in <br>
 the same way.</p>

<p>In the main menu select <code>File &gt; New &gt; Sprite Prefab File</code> to open  <br>
the wizard. In the first page set the prefab name. In the second page  <br>
select the type of the prefab and the texture (not required for the  <br>
<code>Phaser.Text</code> type). </p>

<h4>Object morphing</h4>

<p>It is possible that you create a prefab but later you need to change its <br>
 type, in that case, you can just morph it into the desired type. Just  <br>
right-click on the object and select <code>Sprite &gt; Morph To.. &gt; (  <br>
Sprite | Tile Sprite | Button | Text)</code>.</p>

<h3>More loader control</h3>

<p>We introduced a new <code>autoLoad</code> parameter that you can use in State  <br>
scenes to disable the automatic loading of the assets. </p>

<p>By default, when you drop an object into a State scene, the texture is  <br>
loaded in the <code>preload</code> method of the generated code. However, in bigger <br>
 games, you would like to get full control of when to load the assets,  <br>
for example, a common pattern is to load all of them in a Preloader  <br>
state.</p>

<p>If you want to disable the automatic loading of the assets, then set the <br>
 <code>autoLoad</code> parameter to <code>false</code>. You can find this parameter in the  <br>
<code>Configuration</code> tab in the <code>state&gt; Preload</code> section.</p>

<p>If the <code>autoLoad</code> parameter is set to <code>false</code>, only those section listed <br>
 in the <code>pack</code> parameter will be loaded.</p>

<p><img src="What's new in v1.4.3_files/20171025151011-autoLoadParameter.png" alt="Auto Load parameter" title=""></p>

<h3>Keep layout when dropping sprite-sheet frames</h3>

<p>Often pixel artists deliver their art in form of sprite-sheets where the <br>
 layout of the frames is important. Now in Phaser Editor you can select  <br>
the frames of a sprite-sheet shown in the Preview window and drop them  <br>
into a scene:</p>

<p><img src="What's new in v1.4.3_files/20171025153903-drop-sprite-sheet-frames.gif" alt="Drop sprite-sheet frames" title=""></p>

<p>To select the frames hold the <code>Shift</code> key and move the mouse over  <br>
frames. To clear the selection press <code>ESC</code>.</p>

<h3>Pivot transformation</h3>

<p>To change the pivot of an object (sprite or group), right click on the  <br>
object and select <code>Transform &gt; Pivot</code> (or press <code>V</code>). Like the rest  <br>
of transformation tools, the Pivot transformation tool allows you to  <br>
change the pivot by dragging a handler to the desired position. </p>

<p>In combination with groups and tweens, the pivot transformation tool  <br>
allows creating bones-like animations. Probably we are going to write a  <br>
small tutorial about it.</p>

<h3>Others</h3>

<ul>
<li>Press the <code>U</code> key to select the parent of an object.</li>
<li>When an object is selected in the scene it is revealed in the outline  <br>
window.</li>
<li>The animation dialog scales the images to fit the window, and the  <br>
frames on the left side panel can be in-line previewed.</li>
<li>Code generator uses UTF-8 encoding by default.</li>
<li>The <code>A</code> key opens the animations dialog.</li>
<li>The <code>R</code> key opens the Prefab Override dialog.</li>
<li>Press <code>DEL</code> to reset the value of a color property (like <code>tint</code>) in  <br>
the properties grid.</li>
<li>Added the transformation icons to the scene toolbar: <br>
<img src="What's new in v1.4.3_files/20171026152311-TransformIconsInToolbar.png" alt="Tansformation icons" title=""></li>
</ul>

<h2>Preview window improvements</h2>

<p>The Preview window received some love, images now can be scaled to be  <br>
more readable.</p>

<h3>Atlas preview</h3>

<p>You can preview an atlas asset in three different modes: Tiles  <br>
(default), List and Texture (or Original). To change from one mode to  <br>
other, click on the toolbar buttons:</p>

<p><img src="What's new in v1.4.3_files/20171026094847-atlas.gif" alt="Atlas preview" title=""></p>

<h4>Tiles mode</h4>

<p>The Tile mode is the default mode is open when you drop an atlas asset  <br>
in the Preview window. In this mode, the atlas sprites are scaled to a  <br>
fixed size and placed in rows and columns. You can scroll in/out the  <br>
mouse to zoom the sprites.</p>

<h3>Sprite-sheet preview</h3>

<p>Now the sprite-sheet preview image can be scaled by scrolling the mouse. <br>
 Individual frames can be played by selecting them and pressing the play <br>
 button:</p>

<p><img src="What's new in v1.4.3_files/20171026100035-sprites2.gif" alt="Sprite sheet preview" title=""></p>

<p>As mentioned in a previous section, now you can select some frames and  <br>
drop them into a scene, and keep the same layout. This is very useful if <br>
 you like to create maps like you do in tools like Tiled.</p>

<h2>Local Examples Website</h2>

<p>The Local Examples Website is a small website running in localhost where <br>
 you can browse the Phaser official examples. To access this click on  <br>
this button in the toolbar:</p>

<p><img src="What's new in v1.4.3_files/20171026090850-LaunchLoalWebSite.png" alt="Launch the Examples Local Website" title=""></p>

<p>It starts the local HTTP server and opens the OS browser on the local  <br>
website address. The website is very simple and minimalist, in there you <br>
 can browse all the Phaser examples, run it and see the code. The  <br>
advantage of this website is that you don’t need a fast internet to get  <br>
quickly into the Phaser examples. The drawback is that some examples  <br>
just do not work cause it depends on third-party plugins. Progressively  <br>
we are going to fix them.</p>

<p><img src="What's new in v1.4.3_files/20171026091303-ExamplesLocalWebsiteIndex.png" alt="Index of the Local Examples Website" title=""></p>

<h3>Launch from project wizard</h3>

<p>A nice advantage to have the examples running locally is that you can  <br>
launch an example quickly from different sources, like from a Phaser  <br>
Example Project wizard.</p>

<p>The Phaser Example Project wizard allows you to select one of the Phaser <br>
 examples and create a project with it, but now you have the option of  <br>
runs the example before to create the project, just select the example  <br>
and press the “browse” button:</p>

<p><img src="What's new in v1.4.3_files/20171026092247-LaunchLoalWebSite_FromProjectWizard.png" alt="Play example from project wizard" title=""></p>

<p><img src="What's new in v1.4.3_files/20171026092644-LaunchLoalWebSite_Example.png" alt="Example in the local website" title=""></p>

<h3>Launch from Chains example</h3>

<p>Like in the Phaser Example Project wizard, you can launch an example  <br>
from a Chains query result. The unique difference is that in this case,  <br>
the browser will scroll to the selected line.</p>

<p><img src="What's new in v1.4.3_files/20171026093220-LaunchLoalWebSite_FromChains.png" alt="Launch local website from Chains" title=""></p>

<h2>Internal browser  (experimental)</h2>

<p>Eclipse allows embedding an external browser in an internal window, with <br>
 this component we created a simple game player that you can run inside  <br>
Phaser Editor.</p>

<p>To run a project in the internal player just click on this button:</p>

<p><img src="What's new in v1.4.3_files/20171026110011-InternalBrowser.png" alt="Internal browser" title=""></p>

<p>Note there are two other buttons to select the screen resolution and  <br>
rotate the “device”.</p>

<p>This is a nice feature but with a bad support. In Windows it only  <br>
supports Internet Explorer, in Linux, it just does not work and in MacOS <br>
 it supports Safari. MacOS is the platform where this better works. In  <br>
addition, if you keep the player window open, the whole IDE painting is  <br>
degraded because the game rendering runs in the same thread of the IDE  <br>
painting. Probably this internal player is good just for creating video  <br>
tutorials and screenshots, but was easy and funny to do ;-)</p>

<h2>Others</h2>

<ul>
<li>Better HiDPI monitors support (@2x icons).</li>
<li>Themes are disabled by default. We feel the IDE runs better when the  <br>
theming engine is off. If you like to enable them (we know some users  <br>
prefer to go dark) then open the <code>PhaserEditor.ini</code> file in the root  <br>
folder and remove the lines:</li>
</ul>

<pre><code>-cssTheme
none</code></pre>

<p>This is another update, there is a lot more to come. We look forward to  <br>
supporting Bitmap Font and Tilemap objects. </p>
