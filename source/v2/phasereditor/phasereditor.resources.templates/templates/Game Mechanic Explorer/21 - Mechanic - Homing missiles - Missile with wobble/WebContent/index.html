<p>The missile will target the pointer (or tap). Move the pointer around the example area.</p><p>This example adds a neat little wobble to the straight line motion of the missile. It's purely visual but adds a lot of character. The wobble is implemented as a variable <code>this.wobble</code> that tweens back and forth between two values.</p>
