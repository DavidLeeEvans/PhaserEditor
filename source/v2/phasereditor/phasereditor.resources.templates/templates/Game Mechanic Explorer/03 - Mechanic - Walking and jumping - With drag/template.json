    "description": "<p>Use the arrow keys or tap to move the player left and right.<\/p><p>The player now has a <code>DRAG<\/code> component. <code>DRAG<\/code> works by applying a velocity in the opposite direction of the player movement whenever the player is not accelerating. This causes the player to slow down gradually when no keys are pressed. Note that <code>ACCELERATION<\/code> is greater than <code>DRAG<\/code>. This allows the player to slow down and change direction faster by pressing the opposite arrow key; or to coast to a stop by releasing all of the keys.<\/p>",
