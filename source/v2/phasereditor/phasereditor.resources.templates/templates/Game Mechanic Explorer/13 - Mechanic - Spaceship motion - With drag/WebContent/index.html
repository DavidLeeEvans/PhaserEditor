<p>Use the left and right arrow keys or tap near the edges to rotate the ship. Press the up arrow key or tap the center to turn on the engine.</p><p>The ship now has a <code>DRAG</code> component. <code>DRAG</code> works by applying a velocity in the opposite direction of the ship movement whenever the ship is not accelerating. This causes the ship to slow down gradually when the engine is off.</p>
