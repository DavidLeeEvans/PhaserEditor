    "description": "<p>Move the pointer or tap to move the light.<\/p><p>This version uses a different lighting technique. Rather than draw a bitmap that is overlayed on the scene with the <code>MULTIPLY<\/code> blend mode, each torch object creates a child <code>glow<\/code> object. The <code>glow<\/code> object is drawn on top of each torch with the <code>ADD<\/code> blend mode. This creates a similar but different effect than the other examples. The <code>ADD<\/code> blend mode brightens the colors of everything beneath it. Note the differences where two lights overlap.<\/p>",
