    "description": "<p>Move the pointer or tap to move the light source.<\/p><p>This example casts rays in a circle around the light and finds all of the intersection points. Then a texture is created that connects the dots and fills in the shape. The texture is drawn using the <code>MULTIPLY<\/code> blend mode (WebGL required) which darkens the colors of everything underneath it giving the appearance of a shadow.<\/p><p>This is a fairly intense process but there are lots of ways to optimize it. One way would be to only test the corners of each wall instead of casting hundreds of rays in a circle.<\/p>",
