<p>Use the arrow keys or tap to move the player left and right.</p><p>The player now gradually accelerates from zero to top speed while a key is pressed.</p><p>Did you notice the side-effect caused by the way the movement is coded? If you hold <code>RIGHT</code>, release it, then hold <code>LEFT</code>, the player moves right, stops, then moves left. But if you hold <code>RIGHT</code> then start holding <code>LEFT</code>, the player will gradually change direction to the left. The code to stop the player is never called because a key is being held down at all times. And the player moves left when both keys are held down because <code>LEFT</code> is tested first. You can fix this by stopping the player whenever the movement direction changes. But look at the next example for a better solution.</p>
